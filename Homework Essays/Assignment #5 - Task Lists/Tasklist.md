**Each individual's task does not mean that the listed individual is doing all the work for that task. The assigned individual distributes the work for that task and combines every member's work. The task list displays the head of each of the project's tasks.**

## Forrest Brown's Tasks

1. Research artificial intelligence models to determine which model should be used for the application.
-- Find OpenCV models we can test to determine workout type and repetitions.
-- Find regression models we can test to determine best progressive overload predictions.
2. Design the artificial intelligence that will be used for the application.
-- Find the most effective features for both models to be most efficient.
3. Refine the artificial intelligence model for determining workout information.
-- Optimize both model to give reasonably accurate results quickly.
4. Develop artificial intelligence for determining workout information from the refined design.
-- Workout information includes determining workout type, repetition count, and progressive overload information.
5. Test the artificial intelligence to ensure the information collected is correct and no bugs are present.


## Evan DiFilippo's Tasks

1. Research database models to determine which model should be used for the application.
-- Look at architectures that work best for ObjectBox.
2. Design the database model that will be used for the application.
-- Incorporate ObjectBox best practices.
3. Refine the database model for storing workout information.
-- Ensure that commands and queries are efficient.
4. Develop the database for storing workout information from the refined database model.
5. Test the database to ensure the information is stored correctly and no bugs are present.


## JP Burger's Tasks

1. Research other workout-focused applications' user interfaces to determine what elements work well and elements do not work well.
-- Find the pros and cons of other workout applications on the market.
2. Design a user interface based on the research done on other applications.
-- Ensure our goals of minimal, clear, and fast are met.
3. Refine the user interface to a completed design.
-- Make improvements off of others' recommendations.
4. Develop the user interface based on the refined design.
5. Test the developed user interface to ensure usability and no bugs are present.
