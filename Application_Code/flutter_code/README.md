# The Applicants' Workout Application

This Flutter project is part of the senior design project for the Applicants.

## Project Description

**Team Name**:  The Applicants</br>
**Team Members**: Forrest Brown, Evan DiFilippo, and JP Burger</br>
**Advisor**: Joe Moeller (Kinetic Vision)</br>
**Project Topic**: A workout application for tracking workout information</br>
**Project Abstract**: Our mobile application is a technologically advanced replacement for the common gym notebook. Many casual lifters and almost all serious lifters measure their progress in the gym over time. The most common metric to do this is progressive overload, otherwise known as a continuous increase in weight moved or repetitions performed. The goal of our tracker is not just to digitize the process of tracking progressive overload, but to make it effortless for the user. The app features an intuitive data entry system, visualization of the data, and an optional hands-free data tracking feature that uses motion capture technology to automatically count the user's reps and motivate the user to overload.

## How to debug and build
The debug and build process follows the standard found in the Flutter documentation. Building the application for your specific platform can be done by using the Flutter steps found on Flutter's website. The pages for each platform are as follows:

- Android: https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/android
- iOS: https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/ios
- Windows: https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/windows
- MacOS: https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/macos
- Linux: https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/linux

## Auto Tracking Feature
The Auto Tracking Feature was built in Python, so depending on the location of your build of the workout tracking application, the variable WORKOUT_TRACKER_LOC needs to be updated for your specific machine.
