## Team Names and Project Abstract

**Team Members**: Forrest Brown, Evan DiFilippo, and JP Burger</br>
**Advisor**: Joe Moeller (Kinetic Vision)</br>
**Project Abstract**: Our mobile application is a technologically advanced replacement for the common gym notebook. Many casual lifters and almost all serious lifters measure their progress in the gym over time. The most common metric to do this is progressive overload, otherwise known as a continuous increase in weight moved or repetitions performed. The goal of our tracker is not just to digitize the process of tracking progressive overload, but to make it effortless for the user. The app features an intuitive data entry system, visualization of the data, and an optional hands-free data tracking feature that uses motion capture technology to automatically count the user's reps and motivate the user to overload.

## Budget

Use of motion capture studio (Donated by Kinetic Vision): $6,250*</br>
Motion capture mentorship (Provided by Kinetic Vision employee): $350**</br>
Miscellaneous hardware and resources (Donated by Kinetic Vision): $1,000***</br>

**Total**: $7,600</br>

*This number is calculated by the $500-$2000 per hour estimate from Animost Studio, taking the mean value ($1250) and estimating 5 hours in the studio. However, Kinetic Vision has not placed a 5 hour limit on our motion capture studio use, so this dollar value is subject to change. (Source: https://animost.com/ideas-inspirations/is-motion-capture-expensive/#:~:text=Motion%20capture%20can%20be%20expensive,Number%20of%20subjects)</br>

**This number is estimated based on the cost of classes from The Mocap Vaults. (Source: https://www.themocapvaults.com/classes)</br>

***This number is a very rough estimate. Potential other resources given include but are not limited to: the use of GPUs for ML Training; the use of a single motion capture to test on a smaller scale; potential donation of a motion capture camera if the software is not functional on a mobile device’s camera as discussed in meeting.</br>

Getting to know each team member</br>
Events of meeting:
- Discussed each other's backgrounds
- Reviewed each other's professional biographies (Assignment #1)
- Created Project description (Group part of Assignment #2)

**September 6th, 2023**</br>
Discuss and work on Assignment #3</br>

- Reviewed each other's individual capstone assessment
- Created the team contract

**September 13th, 2023**</br>
Initial contact with Kinetic Vision</br>
Events of meeting:
- Introductions
- Discussed Project Ideas
- Discussed expectations from Kinetic Vision

**September 17th, 2023**</br>
Discuss and work on Assignment #4</br>
Events of meeting:
- Discussed the details of the project
- Created the design diagrams

**September 22nd, 2023 (Kinetic Vision Meeting)**</br>
Meeting with Kinetic Vision to further discuss project details</br>
Events of Meeting:
- Affiliations: 
  - Existing tools on the market lack desired features.
  - Current tools require a lot of manual data entry.
  - Lack of visualization tools/features to look at past data.

- Data entry issues:
  - Can't measure supersets - curls, and then immediately triceps
  - Drop Sets - reducing weight at end of sets

- RepCount:
  - Notes section next to movement
  - Normal, top half, bottom half

- Aspiration: 
  - Reduce the data entry burden on the user

- Metrics: 
  - Weight and rep count - of equipment/activity (e.g. dumb bells)

- New idea: 
  - Metrics on the the human - key measurements to understand effectiveness/progress workout
  - Auto extract key human metrics from cell phone images

- Constraint/challenge: 
  - User experience of setting up a tracking device/tool in a public vs. home environment

- Idea: 
  - Can we do something where we measure the quality of the exercise/activity with simple metrics?

- Idea: 
  - Feature for goals and planning. 
  - Projections/predictions for hitting goals - long periods of time
  - And also micro timeline suggestions to reach those goal
  - Trying to set the correct expectations in terms of goals and current setting

- Constraint/challenge:
  - We are not experts fitness, want to avoid suggesting things that may not be valid/accurate

- Perfect scenario/world: 
  - Screen facing user - front facing camera
  - Hit track for current activity
  - App tracks activity through the entire duration of the activity - e.g. all 3 sets.
  - Note: Don’t limit the number of reps that can be tracked
  - Finish exercise and all data is auto logged

- Constraint/challenge: (with computer vision)
  - May be challenging to auto log the weight being used for activity, but much easier to log the reps

- Idea: 
  - Tempo: during the activity - faster or slower during exercise

- Consumer research: 
  - Ask users what features that would like to see out of a fitness app
  - Riley: could help out with survey design
  - Want to make sure we are biasing the application to our own desires

- Right size this: 
  - Development lifecycle - poc, prototype, mvp
  - What does success look like for senior project
